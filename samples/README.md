# Samples

In a production SOC environment, this directory would contain the original
artifacts associated with the incident, such as:

- The reported phishing email in `.eml` format
- Any email attachments received by the user
- Extracted or decoded artifacts used during analysis

To prevent the distribution of malicious content, no live samples or
attachments are included in this repository.

Relevant indicators, hashes, and analysis findings are documented in the
root-level investigation files.
